        <p>
            C# is an elegant object-oriented programming language that allows developers to create a wide variety of secure and robust applications running on the .NET Framework. This framework consists of two main components: the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which manages code execution and provides core services like memory management, and the Class Library, a collection of classes and interfaces for common programming tasks.
            
        </p>
        <br> <br>
        <h3 class="main__subsection">Variables and Data Types</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The language supports the use of variables to store data dynamically, requiring declaration with a specific name and data type. C# includes built-in data types such as int, float, char, bool, and string. It also facilitates user interaction through methods for printing text to the console and obtaining user input. Additionally, comments can be added for clarity, and constants can be declared for values that remain unchanged throughout the program.
